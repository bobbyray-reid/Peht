# Pe(h)t

## Description

of events for their pets. If you've ever forgotten to schedule your pet's next vet checkup or lost 
track of when to apply flea medication then this app is for you.

## Usage

Then you will have access to edit events inside your pet's profile that you can view, edit or delete.
